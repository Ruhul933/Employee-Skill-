Employee Skill Index Evaluation

Objective:
Develop a sophisticated skill index dashboard in Power BI to evaluate the performance of employees across four key products: deposits, assets, fees, and SES. Each product category encompasses various sub-products. The dashboard will provide a comprehensive analysis of employee proficiency and effectiveness in handling these products and their respective sub-products.
 By leveraging this dashboard, the organization aims to gain insights into employee skill levels, identify areas for improvement, and optimize the workforce to enhance overall productivity and performance across the product portfolio. This tool will enable data-driven decisions regarding skill development and resource allocation, ultimately driving business growth and success.

Dashboard Components:
1.	Overview Section:
	Provides a summary of employee skill index across all products.
	Includes key metrics such as average skill index, total employees evaluated.
	Offers a comparison of skill index between different product categories.

2.	Product-wise Skill Index Analysis:
	Visualizes employee skill index for each product category (deposits, assets, fees, SES).
	Enables users to identify strengths and weaknesses in employee proficiency across different product lines.

3.	Sub-product Performance Analysis:
	Provides detailed insights into employee performance for each sub-product.
	Allows users to identify top performers, areas for improvement, and training needs at a granular level.
Dashboard Interactivity:
•	Users can interact with slicers to filter data based on specific product categories, sub-products, or employee attributes (e.g., department, tenure).
•	Clicking on a specific employee or sub-product in the visualizations will drill down to detailed performance metrics for deeper analysis.
•	Users can compare skill index trends over time or across different departments or teams for benchmarking purposes.
•	The dashboard dynamically updates to reflect changes in employee skill index and product performance, enabling real-time monitoring and decision-making.
